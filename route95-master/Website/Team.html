	<p class="txtpos" style = "color:white">My name is <b  style = "color:red">Aaron Desin</b>, and I'm the lead developer and artist on Route 95.
 I'm responsible for making sure the development process goes smoothly, in addition to contributing code and art assets for the project. 
 Even though I grew up in northern California, I've always had a fascination with the Palm Desert rock scene (particularly Queens of the Stone Age), 
 and the capstone senior game design project sequence at University of California, Santa Cruz offered the perfect opportunity to express that passion, 
 in the form of Route 95. My other interests include composing music, eating, and extreme ironing.</p>

	<p class="txtpos" style = "color:white"> Hey my name is  <b  style = "color:red"> Marco Iskandar</b> and I'm the gameplay programmer and sound engineer. 
	I helped with the behind the scenes work of the UI and I take care of any sound related work.  
	Music has always been in my life ever since I can remember. I hopped on board with this game since I love music/ rhythm games and 
	the rock genre and we're creating something for people to enjoy the rock scene. 
	Some of my interests include video games ( game design major of course), composing music, football, basketball and martial arts.

	<p class="txtpos" style = "color:white">I'm <b  style = "color:red"> Richard Pittman</b>, World Programmer here at Team 95. 
	My job is to implement most of all the world features that Route 95 has, such has chunk based terrain loading, spectrum based terrain deformation, 
	and bezier-spline based road creation, to name a few. The creation of worlds from mere lines of codes is what inspired me to learn programming, 
	and when Route 95 presented me with the opportunity to create such a world, and integrate its creation with rocking procedural music, 
	I had to jump onboard. When I'm not creating and altering vertex meshes with character strings, I like to listen to an assortment of rock and hard techno, 
	learn and teach lightsaber combat with and to my fellow duelists, and cook and eat amazing vegan foods.

<p class="txtpos" style = "color:white">Hey I'm <b  style = "color:red">Muhammad Shafique</b>. I'm the lead tester and one of the gameplay programmers. 
I'm in charge of testing Route 95 to find bugs and see where we could make improvements. 
Along with that, I work with the UI for the instruments/riff editor. Music has always been a big part of my life 
and I joined this project cause I found it to be an intriguing and novel idea. Thus far, it has shown to be just that. 
In my free time, I enjoy playing and watching football and basketball, along with watching some of my favorite tv shows.
